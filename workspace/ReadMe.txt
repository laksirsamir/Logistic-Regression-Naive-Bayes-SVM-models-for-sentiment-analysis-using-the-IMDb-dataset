This code will train and evaluate Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest,
and Gradient Boosting models for sentiment analysis using the IMDb dataset.

Model Training: In addition to Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, we train SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.

Evaluation: We evaluate each model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Visualization: Confusion matrices for all models are plotted to compare their performance visually.

To include deep learning models in our sentiment analysis project, we'll use neural networks from libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.

We'll use a simple feedforward neural network (Dense layers) and a more advanced model like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for sequential data.
